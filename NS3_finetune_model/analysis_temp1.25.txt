ANALYSIS OF SAMPLED SEQUENCES
==============================

Number of duplicates in generated sequences: 80
0.0 percent of generated sequences are present in the training data.


LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF GENERATED DATA:

Number of sequences too short:	3
Number of invalid (with 'B'):	2
Number of valid unique seqs:	495
Mean sequence length:     		14.1 ¡À 4.2
Median sequence length:   		13
Minimal sequence length:  		4
Maximal sequence length:  		22


DISTANCE CALCULATION IN 'PEPCATS' DESCRIPTOR SPACE

Average euclidean distance of sampled to training data:	0.949 +/- 0.484
Average euclidean distance if randomly sampled seqs:	1.067 +/- 0.429
Average euclidean distance if amphipathic helical seqs:	0.919 +/- 0.367


DISTANCE CALCULATION FOR SCALED GLOBAL DESCRIPTORS

Average euclidean distance of sampled to training data:	4.02 +/- 1.85
