ANALYSIS OF SAMPLED SEQUENCES
==============================

Number of duplicates in generated sequences: 3
0.0 percent of generated sequences are present in the training data.


LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF GENERATED DATA:

Number of sequences too short:	2
Number of invalid (with 'B'):	8
Number of valid unique seqs:	190
Mean sequence length:     		18.0 ¡À 8.6
Median sequence length:   		16
Minimal sequence length:  		5
Maximal sequence length:  		37


DISTANCE CALCULATION IN 'PEPCATS' DESCRIPTOR SPACE

Average euclidean distance of sampled to training data:	0.918 +/- 0.448
Average euclidean distance if randomly sampled seqs:	0.840 +/- 0.384
Average euclidean distance if amphipathic helical seqs:	1.012 +/- 0.391


DISTANCE CALCULATION FOR SCALED GLOBAL DESCRIPTORS

Average euclidean distance of sampled to training data:	4.19 +/- 1.84
